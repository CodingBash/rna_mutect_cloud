## Description

This repository contains the tools to deploy the RNA MuTect pipeline in the cloud (specifically in an environment with Cromwell). 

RNA MuTect is a tool developed by [Yizhak et al.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6444/eaaw0726) to detect mutations from RNA sequencing data provided a match-normal sample. This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/RNA_MUTECT_1.0-1) contains the original RNA MuTect code.
